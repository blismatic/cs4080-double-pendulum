# cs4080-double-pendulum

Double Pendulum simulation using Python. Made for CS4080 Concepts of Programming Languages at Cal Poly Pomona.
For the visualization, just run the code normally as the inital conditions have the default values where the theta2 of the first double pendulum system is only different slightly with the theta2 of the second system. The chaotic motion of the pendulum system will make the two systems run much differently over time.
